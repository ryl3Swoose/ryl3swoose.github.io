	<h1>RuneScape and Riley</h1>
  <p>I started playing RuneScape roughly around 2007, when I was in the second grade. I clicked around and made an avatar, a drearily pale man with long black hair, and decided that being covered in the darkest armor with the goldest trim and the biggest sword meant I was cool. I was, of course, right, but I had to do a lot to reach this goal. Unless, of course, I got some help. I left Lumbridge and headed North until I hit a fence. Beyond the fence the ground was scorched and bloodstained, the trees were burnt and dead, and other players were nowhere to be seen. I asked someone what this was. "The wildies" they responded. I asked if they knew where I could find some black armor. "Follow me" they responded.</p>
  <p>I followed and they led me down the fence until we reached a gate. We passed through and took a couple steps. </p>
  <p>Then they killed me. </p>
  <p>In RuneScape, when you die, you drop everything you were carrying and have to return in a certain time limit or it will disappear forever. In areas like the wildies, other players can pick up what you dropped and keep it for themselves. I had been griefed, an occurance in online spaces, typically games, where a newer or inexperienced player is subjected to some form of torment that they were either unaware of or unable to stop. As mentioned in some of the articles referenced elsewhere on this site, the veil between game worlds and the real world can oftentimes be surprisingly thin. This was the first moment that I felt this veil break.</p>
  <p>Griefing happens in many games, though the most societially important example probably occurred in Azeroth, the setting of World of Warcraft. The Corrupted Blood Incident, as it's called, is worthy of research all on its own, but the largest takeaway in my opinion is this; people will act against the best interests of everyone in a space if there isn't any punishment against it, even if there's no reward for doing so. As noted by Crowe and Bradford, since the Magic Circle is permeable, is there any reason to believe that this behavior is exclusive to virtual spaces?</p>

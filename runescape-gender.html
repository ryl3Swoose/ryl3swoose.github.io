	<h1>RuneScape and Gender</h1>
  <p>RuneScape allows you to customize an avatar; a character you control through which you interact with the game world. Jenny Hissa, in her <a href = "https://www.academia.edu/9744689/Our_Virtual_Bodies_Ourselves_Embodiment_and_the_Practice_of_Gender_Bending_in_the_Digital_World_of_Runescape#references"> examination of gender expression in RuneScape</a> determines that "Virtual play, to a certain extent, seems to allow male payers a freedom – a 
freedom to be – that they most likely don’t experience in daily life." In the sense she describes, virtual spaces such as RuneScape allow boys to play dress-up for the first time in their lives; having a customized character is enviable in these virtual spaces – a sign of investment and prestige. Despite this apparent freedom, RuneScape tends to incorporate real-world societal norms for expression. Male avatars are often seen wearing full suits of armor, while female ones are expected to wear cosmetic items. This dichotomy between freedom of expression and enforcement of societal norms is explored more in Crowe and Bradford's article <a href = "https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14733280601005740" >‘Hanging out in Runescape’: Identity, Work and Leisure in the Virtual Playground</a>. The article notes that RuneScape (albeit the RuneScape of 2006) is demarcated from the real world in a notable way, though the barrier between the two is not solid. It calls to mind the idea of the Magic Circle, that all games exist within a kind of "magic circle" wherein the rules of the game apply atop and alongside existing societal rules. Within this circle, for example, an American Male playing a Male avatar specialized in Armor and Strength is expected to perform both as an American Male socially and as a Strong Armored warrior in the game. Changing any of these aspects, regardless of whether or not they have immediate notable gameplay impact, affects how one is expected to act within the Magic Circle containing RuneScape.</p>

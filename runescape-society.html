	<h1>RuneScape and The Economy</h1>
  <p>Runescape has a robust player-to-player economy, epitomized in the Grand Exchange. Players are able to sell items off, giving a starting price and returning when the item is sold. Because of this, players who aren't interested in certain aspects of the game can still benefit from those who are. For example, a player who wants good armor but isn't interested in the crafting system can browse the Grand Exchange for a suitable set of armor, or a player who enjoys crafting but only needs one set of armor can sell their extras.</p>
  <p>In 2009, <a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1521563">Tanla E. Bilir</a> proposed using virtual worlds such as RuneScape "as a laboratory for testing economic behavior and theory." Their exploration determined that RuneScape could in fact be a fertile ground for such studies, which takes us to Bonds.</p>
  <p>RuneScape introduced <a href = "https://web.archive.org/web/20140113205115/http://services.runescape.com/m=news/g=runescape/an-important-message-from-mod-mmg">Bonds</a> in September of 2013. Bonds are an in-game item that allows players to extend their membership, among other benefits. They are bought with real-world currency but can be traded from player-to-player; this allows the in-game currency of gold to have a real-world value, blurring the line between a player's wallet and their avatar's. Several other online games, such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft, specifically forbid or mechanically disallow the trading of real-world-valued items. Despite this, Bonds remain in RuneScape and many players consider them a useful way to extend playtime without spending their real-world money.</p>
